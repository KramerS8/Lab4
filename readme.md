United Nations Sustainable Development Goal #6

Ensure access to water and sanitation for all

The UN explains: "Clean water is a basic human need, and one that should be easily accessible to all. There is sufficient fresh water on the planet to achieve this. However, due to poor infrastructure, investment and planning, every year millions of people — most of them children — die from diseases associated with inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene."

This map shows the share of the population using safely managed drinking water in North America in the year 2020.

Functions: I used functions to change the style for the header, perceptual circles, and legend.

Data Sources: The text for the description box is provided by the OurWorldInData.org/water-access who got the data from WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation. The coordinates I got from Google Maps and converted it to a GeoJson file using geojson.io. I got the basemap from leaflet provider demo.
